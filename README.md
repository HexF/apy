# apy

APY is a collection of useful APIs.

APY exposes hundreds* of APIs that are only 1 `GET` request away.

\* Currently hundreds = 0, but in the near future there will be hundreds

## Motivation

My movitves behind this project are to create a single place to do all sorts of weird and wonderful things with web APIs, from grabbing your public IP address, to encoding a QR code, to even finding operating system downloads.

## Licensing

APY provides a 100 requests a day limit. This is enforced per IPv4 address, or per /16 IPv6 prefix.
Sponsor my GitHub account for $5/m or more to have this limit lifted for your IP address
